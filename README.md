# Springboard_Capstone_1

This repository contains the dataset, slides presentation, write-up, and Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for my first capstone project for Springboard's data science career track. 

In this project, my goal was to use an exploratory approach to text data analysis, using things like word clouds to visually represent text data for EDA. I utilized a Naive Bayes classifier with two different approaches to vectorization and tuned basic hyperparameter settings (i.e. alpha) to try to improve model performance. This project represents my first exploration into how to gain insight from text data using visualization and NLP techniques.
